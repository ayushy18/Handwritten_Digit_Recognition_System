# Handwritten_Digit_Recognition_System
The project is a Handwritten Digit Recognition System. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) from the provided dataset (Train.csv, test.csv). The goal is to design, train, and evaluate a deep learning model that achieves high accuracy in automatically recognizing handwriting styles.
